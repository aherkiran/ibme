We provide\n    different types of content writing for local businesses, International\n    Companies and Start-ups.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Localization</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Localization is the means of altering a product or content to a specific\n    locality or market. Translation is only one of several elements of the\n    localization process. In addition to translation, the localization process\n    may also include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Adjusting graphics to target markets\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Reworking on matter to suit the tastes and consumption habits of\n            other markets\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Adapting design and layout to properly display translated text\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Converting to local requirements (such as currencies and units of\n            measure)\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Using proper local formats for dates, addresses, and phone numbers\n        </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>\n            Addressing local regulations and legal requirements\n        </p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The aim of localization is to give a product the look and feel of having\n    been created specifically for a target market, no matter their language,\n    culture, or location.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Transcription</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Transcription in several languages with high level of accuracy and quick\n    turnaround time. This helps give our customers a real economic advantage.\n    We can provide a dedicated team of bilingual transcriptionists who offer\n    flexible solutions to meet all your business needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Multilingual DTP</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Your designed promotional pamphlets or regular publications make perfect\n    sense in your home country, yet crossing the borders requires them to be\n    translated, or more accurately; localized. Traditional translation will not\n    probably accomplish your needs since the document layout might need to be\n    redesigned as per the target language requirements, you actually need\n    something more. That is simply called desktop publishing services or DTP\n    and in some cases known as Typesetting. Examples of documents that require\n    desktop publishing services are brochures, pamphlets, manuals, catalogues,\n    or magazines.\n</p>\n",
